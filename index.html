  <h3>My Basketball Life 2013-2019</h3>
  <p>I started my basketball carrier when I was age of 9. There is a basketball club named Magicball and they are doing their trainings at our school's court therefore I was impressed by them and I decided to join them. I stayed there just for a year
    and afterward I joined another basketball club that named OzU Basketball and I stayed there for
    until 2016. In 2016 I continued my basketball life at MVP Basketball and I joined lots of tournaments in there...</p>

  <h3>About My Experiences</h3>
  <h4>Amazon Dropshipping</h4>
  <p>I opened my dropshipping account in the summer of 2020. During the pandemic days I was wondering to know money earning ways.
    And one day I heard about this way and I interested in therefore I did a researched for 2 months and at the end of 2 months I knew every detail of it afterward I opened
    my dropshipping account and I started to adding products into my store's inventory. And I did my first sale adter 3-4 month work. My endorsement was 1000 Turkish Lira's.</p>

  <h4>Stock Market - Self Trader</h4>
  <p>As I said in the dropshipping section I was curious about earning money so like my dropshipping research I did a research for stock market too and honestly it was
    more complicating from dropshipping but it was a great experinece.</p>
  <hr>
  <h4>Tour Guide</h4>
  <p>In the summer of 2018 I was volunteered for a position of helper of the tour guide. I volunteered it because I really wanted to see the other countires
    and also I believe I can improve my language with this 15 day tour, and I was right. At least %90 of the tour members didn't know how to talk in English so I helped them in all issues
    . For Instance; In Venice our tour guide was Italian and he was speaking English so I was the translator between them. Also I helped our tour members about bargaining in some stores because as I said they didn't know
    how to talk in English and finally I helped them in their some accomodation problems in hotels. And I helped them more issues... It was a win win thing. I either travelled all around the Europe
    and also I worked in there it was a beautiful experience in my life. We travelled Bulgaria, Slovenia, Serbia, Austria, France, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Hungary and more contries...</p>
